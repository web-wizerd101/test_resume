<u><h1>INTRODUCTION</h1></u>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello! I am a diligent and ambitious student currently pursuing B-Tech in Computer Science and Communication Engineering at KIIT UNIVERSITY, where I have maintained an impressive CGPA of 7.50. I take great pride in my academic achievements, having secured an exceptional score of 80.4% in the Higher Secondary Exam from Baranagar Vidyamandir School (WBCHSE board), and an outstanding 92% in the Secondary Exam as a School Topper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the realm of technical skills, I possess a firm grasp of the fundamental concepts of Java Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), while also being a self-taught enthusiast in Python Language. My passion for web development has led me to acquire substantial knowledge in Front-End web development, and during a rewarding internship at DoO(C&S), I gained hands-on experience and honed my skills in Web development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond the realm of technology, I take pride in my non-tech skills, which include self-confidence that empowers me to excel in presentations and engage with others effectively. My natural leadership qualities enable me to guide and inspire others towards shared objectives. Moreover, I consider myself a fast learner, always seeking to expand my horizons and take up fresh challenges with enthusiasm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my leisure time, I enjoy immersing myself in various interests. I find solace in reading books and take delight in crafting intriguing stories through my writing. Exploring the world of dramas offers me a wonderful escape, and I always embrace opportunities to learn new things that broaden my perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from my proficiency in Bengali, which is my native language, I am fluent in English and Hindi, allowing me to communicate effortlessly with people from diverse linguistic backgrounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a relentless drive for continuous learning and a passion for exploration, I am eager to embrace novel challenges and make meaningful contributions to any endeavor I undertake. I look forward to leveraging my skills, knowledge, and experiences to make a positive impact on the world around me.</p>
